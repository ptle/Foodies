# Project 3 - *Foodies*

**Foodies** is a Yelp search app using the [Yelp API](http://www.yelp.com/developers/documentation/v2/search_api).

Time spent: **8** hours spent in total

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does).

The following **optional** features are implemented:

- [x] Search results page
   - [x] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.
   - [x] Implement map view of restaurant results.
- [x] Implement the restaurant detail page.

The following **additional** features are implemented:

- [x] Improved User Interface by using colors similar to Yelp app
- [x] Used annotations on mapview to show location. (Can click and can see address)
- [x] Used Auto Layout for detail page.
- [x] Implemented network error incase API call falls
- [x] Implemented load screen to show user data is loading

Please list two areas of the assignment you'd like to **discuss further with your peers** during the next class (examples include better ways to implement something, how to extend your app in certain ways, etc):

1. Good techniques for Auto Layout
2. Approaches for implementing some of the optionals (i.e. infinite looping)
